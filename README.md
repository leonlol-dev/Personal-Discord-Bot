# Quick Brief 

At the moment, there are two features that my discord bot helps me with on a daily. They are just small quality of life changes that helps me speed through certain tasks.

# Bus Stop helper

My bot has a function where it web scrapes a number of bus sites that my small town has and compiles it into a message that I can easily read and find out which bus stop to go to. I created this feature as there are multiple bus companies within the town I live in and I didn't want to download their apps as it would clog up my phone as well as being a pain to look through two apps to find an optimal bus.

# Ebay Assistant
My bot also scrapes ebay and helps me find better deals by finding the average cost of an item.

# Loyalty Cards

Another functionality is that it has a number of my loyalty cards stored as images and with a command - the bot will send me an image of a bar code which is shown to an employee. Did this so I didn't have to log in / find a screenshot of my loyalty cards.
